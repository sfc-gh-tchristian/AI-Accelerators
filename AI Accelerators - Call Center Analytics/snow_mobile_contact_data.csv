No problem, I can help reset that for you. Can I take your number and date of birth for security? 07748 997448, and my date of birth is 3rd June 1992. Thank you Ellie. I can reset your voicemail PIN remotely. Would you like to set a new 4-digit PIN now, or use the default which is the last 4 digits of your phone number? What would the default be then? That would be 7448. However, I'd recommend choosing your own PIN for security - something memorable but not obvious like your birthday. Good point. Can I set it to 1967? That's my mum's birth year. Perfect. I've set your voicemail PIN to 1967. It's active immediately. Try accessing your voicemail now by holding down 1. Yes, it's asking for the PIN... and I'm in! I have 3 messages. Thank you! Excellent! Make a note of that PIN somewhere safe. Anything else I can help with? No, that's perfect. Thanks so much! You're welcome, Ellie. Have a great day!""}"

What's your number? 07721 889900. Okay, looking at your bill now. Which charges are you concerned about? There's £8.99 for something called premium SMS, and £12 for data overage. Right, so the premium SMS is from a competition you entered, and the data overage is because you went over your 15GB limit. I didn't enter any competition. Can you remove that charge? Well, it shows here that you did. But I suppose I could credit it back this once. And what about the data charge? I thought I had unlimited data. No, you're on 15GB. If you want unlimited, that's a different plan. Could I switch to that? Yeah, probably. Let me just credit the £8.99 first... Done. For the unlimited plan, you'd need to call our upgrades team.
