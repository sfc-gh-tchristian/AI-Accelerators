    "## 1. üéØ **Deploy Manufacturing Assistant**\n",
    "Integrate the search service and AI capabilities into your CMMS or create a standalone Streamlit application for your maintenance teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. üìä **Expand Semantic Views**\n",
    "Head to **AI > Studio > Cortex Analyst** to create and update semantic views of your manufacturing data, enabling natural language reporting and self-service analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. ü§ñ **Build Manufacturing Agents**\n",
    "Use the search services and AI functions as tools for intelligent agents that can:\n",
    "- Automatically generate maintenance plans\n",
    "- Monitor equipment health in real-time\n",
    "- Predict failures before they occur\n",
    "- Optimize maintenance schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. üîÑ **Integrate with Your Systems**\n",
    "Connect these AI capabilities directly to your CMMS, ERP, or existing manufacturing systems through APIs for seamless workflow integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. üìà **Scale Across Manufacturing Operations**\n",
    "Roll out to your entire manufacturing organization with:\n",
