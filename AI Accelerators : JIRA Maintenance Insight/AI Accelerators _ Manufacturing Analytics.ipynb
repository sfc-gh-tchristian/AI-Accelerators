    "# 🏭 AI-Powered Manufacturing Intelligence Demo w/ Snowflake Cortex\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Purpose\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how manufacturing teams leverage Snowflake's Cortex AI capabilities to transform traditional JIRA production data into actionable manufacturing intelligence. Experience conversational AI that answers complex operational questions, identifies critical failure patterns, and generates predictive maintenance insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why do this?\n",
    "- 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**: AI-driven pattern recognition to identify recurring problems and their sources\n",
    "- ⚡ **Downtime Prevention**: Predictive insights to prevent equipment failures before they occur\n",
    "- 🔧 **Maintenance Optimization**: Intelligent scheduling based on failure patterns and asset health\n",
    "- 📊 **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated tracking of safety and quality requirements\n",
    "- 🏆 **Process Excellence**: Identify best practices and replicate high-performing operations\n",
    "- 📈 **Operational Efficiency**: Real-time insights into production line performance and bottlenecks\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Natural language queries for maintenance planning\n",
    "   - Semantic search across incident history and equipment data\n",
    "   - Contextual recommendations and maintenance actions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Common Scenarios\n",
    "*\"What's causing the most downtime on Production Line A this month?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Which equipment showed repeated failures and what was the root cause?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Show me all compliance incidents that took longer than 24 hours to resolve.\"*\n",
