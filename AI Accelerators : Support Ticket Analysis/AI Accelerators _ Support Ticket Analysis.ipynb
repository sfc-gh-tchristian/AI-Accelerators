    "# ✨ Support Ticket Analysis powered by Snowflake Cortex\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Purpose\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to analyse customer support tickets using Snowflake's Cortex AI capabilities to identify trends, sentiment patterns, and critical issues that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why do this?\n",
    "- 🔍 **Early Issue Detection**: Identify system-wide problems and outages through pattern recognition\n",
    "- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis**: Track customer satisfaction across multiple dimensions (brand, product, support)\n",
    "- ⚡ **Automated Escalation**: Use AI to determine which tickets require immediate escalation\n",
    "- 📈 **Trend Analysis**: Visualize ticket volumes and sentiment patterns over time\n",
    "- 🚀 **Efficient Support**: Quickly find similar cases using semantic search capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Solution Components\n",
    "Note: a combination of SQL & Python will be used for the same outcome. Pick your preferred route!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📊 **Data Visualisation & EDA**\n",
    "   - Use in-built streamlit functionality to see:\n",
    "   - Weekly ticket volume by priority\n",
    "   - Sentiment trends over time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**\n",
    "   - Issue summarization using `AI_AGG`\n",
    "   - Automated outage detection with `AI_FILTER`\n",
    "   - Multi-dimensional sentiment analysis with `AI_SENTIMENT`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ⚙️ **Automated Pipeline**\n",
    "   - CDC for automated ticket processing\n",
    "   - Scheduled updates for search indices\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🎯 **Accurate Retrieval**\n",
    "   - Semantic search for case similarity matching\n",
    "   - Quantitative analysis through semantic views \n"
