# AI-Accelerators
Accelerators to show the full suite of Cortex features across real life use cases.

To quickly access these Accelerators - simply enable Git integration with this repository following these steps:
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; -- or any role with API integration privileges
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS AI_SOL;

CREATE OR REPLACE API INTEGRATION git_api_integration
    API_PROVIDER = git_https_api
    API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES = ('https://github.com/') -- feel free to scope this
    ENABLED = TRUE
    COMMENT = 'API Integration for Git repository access';

CREATE OR REPLACE GIT REPOSITORY AI_SOL.PUBLIC.ACCELERATOR_REPO
    API_INTEGRATION = git_api_integration
    ORIGIN = 'https://github.com/sfc-gh-tchristian/AI-Accelerators'
    COMMENT = 'Git repository containing AI accelerators';
```
